 Password Generator (homework3)

Here comes another super informative and exciting readme.

As I'm sure you're well aware from the title, this is a password generator.
I created the portion of code between the "WRITE YOUR CODE HERE" comment and the "END OF LINE" comment.
I began pseudo-coding to come up with my necessary ideas as if it was a different language. (THANK YOU ABDUL!)
I then started coding off with creating several arrays of characters and a single empty array.
I broke the arrays up by character type. Lowercase letters, Uppercase letters, Numbers, and acceptable password Special Characters.
I then lost my mind for a couple of days trying to figure out how to format the rest.
After much Google-fu practice, I settled on trying to do something that didn't work.
Following class on Thursday I attempted several iterations of conditionals to try and subtract characters from a single whole string. DIDN'T WORK.
More Google-fuing.
Saturday I was able to understand a few more things in class than normal which helped. But John was the one who really helped by lending his eyes to my code.
We determined that subtracting arrays from a whole string was the hard way. So we uncommented my addiction method.
John helped me figure out why my arrays weren't 'concat'ing together. FIXED.
I attempted several different random number generators but the majority only gave me single elements of my arrays.
After much more Google-fuing I finally figured out how to read the generators well enough to alter them correctly.

NOTE: I suck at math and this was really difficult.

After finally getting the arrays and generator to work together, I ditched my extra code, cleaned everything and commented the sections.
I'm pretty sure that's the sum of my experience with homework 3. Enjoy my blood, cussing and confusion.

NOTE: I just want to say, that this has been much harder than the last two homeworks.

DISCLAIMER: I didn't touch a thing in the HTML file or the CSS file. IT'S NOT MY FAULT IF SOMETHING IS WRONG THERE. :)
