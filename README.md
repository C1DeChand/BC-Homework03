## Random Password Generator:

The name says it all. This is a random password generator. It prompts the user on what and how many characters they want in the password. It then takes the users answers and generates a password which is then displayed.

## Breakdown:

1. When you hit the generate button, it will prompt you.
2. The prompts will ask you what types of characters you want in the password.
3. It will then ask you how long of a password you would like.
4. After all prompts have been answered, it will generate and display a password on the page.
5. Simply copy and past the password wherever you need it or generate a new password if you didn't like that one after all.
